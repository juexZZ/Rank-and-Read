# Rank-and-Read
My codes, exp results and model checkpoints of the bridging neural rankers and machine readers

## models/checkpoints
checkpoints of all my trained models are here:

By downloading and unzip this file, you should have all the models' checkpoints that can give the same results in our paper through inference/predicition.

The results can also be download here:

Both reading comprehension results(candidate answer spans in `readings.zip`) and ranker results(ranking scores for each passage in `rankings.zip`) are available.
